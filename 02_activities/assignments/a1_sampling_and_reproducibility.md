# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 100 (from the original 1000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitby’s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

Q1:
    Stages of sampling:
        - Simple random sampling for infecting a random set of people: "infected_indices = np.random.choice(ppl.index, size=int(len(ppl) * ATTACK_RATE), replace=False)" the code combines wedding and brunches and infects 10% of the total population, it does not distinguish between events. 
            Sampling frame: everyone at the events (1000)
            Sampling size: 10%
            How it relates to blog post: it's slightly different from blogpost I think? Because it's 10% infection rate of entire population instead of 10% of weddings and 10% of brunches
        - Simple random sampling for deciding which infected people get traced: " ppl.loc[ppl['infected'], 'traced'] = np.random.rand(sum(ppl['infected'])) < TRACE_SUCCESS", again everyone within the infected population have the same chance of being traced regardless of events.
            Sampling frame: infected population
            Sampling size: 20%
            How it relates to blog post: infections have a 20% of tracing rate
        - Multi-stage sampling? for determining who gets traced: 
            "event_trace_counts = ppl[ppl['traced'] == True]['event'].value_counts()
            events_traced = event_trace_counts[event_trace_counts >= SECONDARY_TRACE_THRESHOLD].index
            ppl.loc[ppl['event'].isin(events_traced) & ppl['infected'], 'traced'] = True"

            Sampling frame: traced population
            Sampling size: all of traced population
            How it relates to blog post: If 2 or more people are traced to the same event, then everyone infected in that event who is infected are considered 'traced'
Q2: 
It doesn't match the blog post graph (true vs observed), it has a lower observed (traced) rate to weddings than the blog post. I think it might be because it applied 10% infection rate over the entire sample instead of the events separately. In the blog post, none of the brunch event would undergo a secondary tracing because there's only 1 person traced to each event, leading to higher observed rate from weddings. This is not a restriction in the code. Is this observation correct?

Q3:
Reproducibility is low, the observations change between simulations and do not always concentrate around the same centre due to the decrease in simulations numbers.

Q4:
Added np.random.seed(10) on line 19 for reproducibility
